This mod introduces realistic character textures featuring female and male nudity. To increase anatomical realism, male characters come with a new extra 3d-object attached between their legs. The mod also introduces new options for your character's body hair.

For a detailed description of the mod's content, see the mod's page in the steam workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832911317&searchtext=

IMPORTANT: This mod includes some nudity and is therefore intended for mature audience only. However, no sexually explicit elements are contained in the mod.

- 1.4.1: fixed visual enhancement for male characters when moving around nude introduced in 1.4 sometimes didn't apply (that happened when the mod has been enabled via the main menu and/or a game was loaded the first time after opening PZ); added compatibility for the mod "Anthro Survivors (the "Furry" mod)"

- 1.4.2: added Russian translation (thanks to various steam users for contributing translations!)

- 1.4.3: increased compatibility with the mod "Better Satchel"; increased compatibility with the mod "Improved Hair Menu" (when playing with Improved Hair Menu, the male beard stubble growth mechanics is now disabled to avoid problems; shaving beard stubble is also not possible anymore when playing with Improved Hair Menu -> summary: beard stubble should now behave exactly as in the vanilla game when Improved Hair Menu is enabled); increased compatibility for a certain clothing item from the mod "The Last of Us: Factions & Gear"; added compatibility for the mod "Lifestyle" (the bathing options from this mod should now also clean the new skins introduced by my mod) 

- 1.5: updated mod to build 42; simplified texture management: now, there are base character textures and every body hair element comes as a single texture; the body hair elements get then pasted on the base textures (such a simple system wasn't possible in pre-41.6 versions since this caused some weird graphical glitches; those glitches aren't present in more recent game versions); number of textures has thereby been reduced from 900+ to ca 60; the new texture management is present in the b41 as well as in the b42 version of the mod; some textures might look slightly different than in previous mod version but I tried to keep the overall look as good as possible 

- 1.5.1: fixed a new vanilla clothing which caused clipping for male characters; made the avatar during character customisation slighty larger than it was in 1.5

- 1.5.2: removed some experimental code which improves performance a bit when in Customise Character screen with all-clothing-unlocked enabled; performance issues are not related to my mod and were already present for me in the vanilla game; removing the code may lead to better compatibility with other mods and future game updates 

- 1.5.3: only applies to B42: increased avatar size during character customisation a bit; turned down split normals of male 3d object to make it look less glowing when in certain lighting situations; added possibility that the new b42 item Base.StraightRazor can be used for shaving body hair; increased body hair grow time (now 4-5 days till the next growth state, before 3-4); fixed some clothing items not getting undressed when shaving body hair covered by the clothing; fixed some progress bars during shaving don't disappear when player manually aborted the action; simplified UI when shaving/cutting beard 

- 1.5.4: fixed some clothing items not hiding the male extra 3d object (some suite jacktes, pants and skirts); fixed comboBox briefly changing size during character creation menu; all problems have been introduced by a recent
B42 update

- 1.5.5: added Turkish translation (thanks to various steam users for contributing translations!)

- 1.5.5-Hotfix: fixed Turkish translation

- 1.5.6: only applies to B42: fixed a small issue about wrong bodyLocations during character creation; added incompatible mods to the mod.info file; fixed some crafted dresses not hiding the male private area properly; fixed buggy ui during character customisation occuring when player chooses "continue with new character" after character death; made color, texture and decal buttons properly visible during character creation; re-introduced compatibility patches for some other mods (bathing feature from lifestyle mods, several clothes from clothes box redux, anthro survivors, yaki's barber shop); changed body location of bandeaus so that they can be worn with UnderwearTop items, changed body location of crop tops so that they can be worn together with tank tops (vanilla game has some inconsistency between the item's real body location and their menu slot during character customisation) 

- 1.5.7 (current): adjusted the B42 version of the mod to the new body location system introduced in 42.12.0 (this fixes game-breaking bugs introduced in the recent 42.12.0 vanilla update)



------------------------- TECHNICAL/FOR MODDERS/MISC -------------------------


There are quite a few mods in the steam workshop introducing new character textures and nudity. Examples are "YYM331`s Nude Texture", "Simple Character Retextures (male and female + makeup)" or several mods by TED BEER. The differences between those mods and this one (to my best knowledge): this mod introduces more body hair options, body hair growth and a new 3d model for a human penis.

The newly introduced character textures, body hair elements and the penis model are realized as clothing items. The game is then manipulated in a way so that the players should not notice that these things are in fact clothing items (e.g. not undressable, not shown in inventory...).

The mod introduces 8 new body locations: RasSkin, RasPubicHair, RasChestHair, RasLegHair, RasArmpitHair, RasMalePrivatePart, RasBeardStubble, RasHeadStubble. They are prefixed to the vanilla list of body locations (or to any list of body locations introduced by any mod which is loaded before this one).

Vanilla functions are not overwritten. In several cases, vanilla functions are modified using constructions like

local old_vanillaFunction = vanillaFunction
function vanillaFunction(...)

         --[[ my new code ]]--

         old_vanillaFunction(...) -- execute the vanilla function
         
         --[[ my new code ]]--
end

The mod touches a lot of different game systems (clothing, washing, shaving, sitting and fitness animations, various interface elements, ...). This has been necessary to make it fit my vision. Despite of this, I tested it with several other mods from more popular collections in the steam workshop and it seems to be surprisingly compatible. There are still some mods which definitely cause problems. More info on compatibility can be found on the mod's steam workshop page.
